download link: https://textools.dualwield.net

2. make sure to backup index files

TexTools should propose you to do it at first start or whenever they changes. If not: `[Help -> Backup Index Files]`

3. Import the modpack

You can place the mod folder in `...\TexTools\ModPacks\` for easy keeping but that's not necessary
`[Mods -> Import ModPacks]` and select the `.ttmp2` file.

4. Go hunting!

## What to do for new FFXIV Patches

A FFXIV update will, in most if not all cases, overwrite and disable the mod.
Usually, just re-enabling the mod (`[Mods -> Mod List -> Mod Pack, select and Enable]`) is enough.

Safe procedure:

1. Hit `[Help → Start Over]`
2. Download new FFXIV patch
3. Hit `[Help → Backup Index Files]`
4. Import the mod

## Disclaimers

Use of this mod is at your own risk. Square Enix does not permit the use of any third party tools, even those which do not modify the game. They have stated in interviews that they did not view parsers as a significant problem unless players use them to harass other players.

## Customization

Individual maps are available in the repo under `Saved/UI/Maps/[region]/[zone]`.

The tool to render these maps will be released shortly so you can generate your own maps.
