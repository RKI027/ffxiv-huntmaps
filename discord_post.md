**FFXIV Elite Marks Annotated Maps**

This is a mod pack for FFXIV to replace in-game maps with annotated ones.
Annotations show spawn positions for all elite marks: A, B, S, SS (Forgiven Rebellion and Gossips)

**Installing**
1. Download and install FFXIV TexTools at <https://textools.dualwield.net>
2. make sure to backup index files

TexTools should propose you to do it at first start or whenever they changes. If not: `[Help -> Backup Index Files]`

3. Import the modpack
  * download it at <https://github.com/RKI027/ffxiv-huntmaps/releases>
  * you can place the mod folder in `...\TexTools\ModPacks\` for easy keeping but that's not necessary
  * Hit `[Mods -> Import ModPacks]` and select the `.ttmp3` file.

4. Launch FFXIV and go hunting!

**What to do for new FFXIV Patches**
A FFXIV update will, in most if not all cases, overwrite and disable the mod.
Usually, just re-enabling the mod (`[Mods -> Mod List -> Mod Pack, select and Enable]`) is enough.

Safe procedure:
1. Hit `[Help → Start Over]`
2. Download new FFXIV patch
3. Hit `[Help → Backup Index Files]`
4. Import the mod
